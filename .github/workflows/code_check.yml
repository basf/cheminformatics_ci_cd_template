# This is a template for a CI/CD workflow for your own Python package.
#
# Copy this template in to your repository and adapt it according to
# the TODOs. All relevant parts are marked with a `TODO` in the following.

name: code_check

env:
  # TODO for the user of this template: adapt the following variables to the names in your project.
  #
  # The template is designed for developing a Python package in the form:
  # project_template/
  # ├── package_src/
  # │   └── __init__.py
  # ├── tests/
  # │   └── __init__.py
  # The template can't know the name of the `package_src` and `tests` directories.
  # So, you have to add them here:

  # set the name of your Python package directory
  PY_PACKAGE_DIR: package_src

  # set the name of your unit test directory
  PY_UNIT_TEST_DIR: tests

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]
